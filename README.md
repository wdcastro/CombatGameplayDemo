# JRPGEngine
A free-to-use JRPG engine developed as a hobby, let me know if you make something with it please :D

Features:
- Tiled TMX map support (XML)
- WASD Movement (configurable hotkeys soon to come)
- Background music, sound effect
- Menus (customisable with CSS)
- Click to interact (different interactions for near and far)
- Collision checking (with Tiled custom bool property COLLIDABLE)
- NPC and Cutscene support

There's only a bare minimum of code so that it can be used as a template for other games. There's not much functionality added and can be converted into a Platformer or Hack n Slash quite comfortably.
No documentation available as of yet but I'll try to respond if you email me: william.i.dcastro@gmail.com
